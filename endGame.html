                    You found a bloody knife in the safe with Victor's DNA on it. 
                    Charles' body was found dead near the safe so it must've been open at the time of murder.

                    The burnt letter you found in the living room explained Victor's motive, 
                    as Charles illegally caused him to lose his mediacl license.
